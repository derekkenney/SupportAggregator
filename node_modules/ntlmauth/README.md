ntlmauth
========

NTLM Authentication implemented in Javascript for use with NodeJS. This library was created to support NTLM authentication for SQL Server connections, it's now being tested in a branch of Tedious. Funnily enough the authentication bits work pretty well - the actual TDS is broken.

This code is experimental, and it comes with no assurance that it will do much more than crash and burn. Use it at your own risk.
